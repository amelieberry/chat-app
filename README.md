## Key Features

### Set up the Database
Chat messages are stored on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), version 8.2.3.
Firebase documentation can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

* In your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com), create a project in test mode.
* In your project's directory, run `npm install firebase@8.2.3`.
* At the top of your Chat.js file, import Firebase: `import firebase from 'firebase';`
* Back in the Firebase Console, navigate to Project Settings and select the `</>` icon to register the application.
* Copy the data received in the last step and store it in a variable:
>```js
>const firebaseConfig = {
>  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
>  authDomain: 'your-authdomain',
>  databaseURL: 'your-database-url',
>  projectId: 'your-project-id',
>  storageBucket: 'your-storage-bucket',
>  messagingSenderId: 'your-messaging-sender-id',
>  appId: 'your-app-id',
>};
>```
* Initialize the app:
>```js
>if (!firebase.apps.length) {
>        firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
>    }
>```
* Create a reference to the collection in Firestore:
>```js
>const referenceChatMessages = firebase.firestore().collection('messages');
>```
